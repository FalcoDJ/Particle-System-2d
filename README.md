# Particle System 2d

## Intructions

To run this just run ```./run.sh```

If you would like to run it in debug mode type ```./run.sh -d 144``` or ```./run.sh --debug 144```
`You MUST input your desired FPS when running in debug mode!`
The reason for debug mode is to test how many particles could run on your system while keeping your desired FPS. It will constantly add more particles until your FPS drops below double the desired FPS. Example: I told it I wanted 60FPS, and my ideal amount of particles was 73000 while not dropping below 120FPS.
